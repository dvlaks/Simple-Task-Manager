It is built using React for the frontend and Redux for state management. Material-UI components enhance the user interface, and Firebase is integrated for user authentication and data storage.

- **Create Tasks:** Users can add tasks with titles, priorities, and due dates.
- **Manage Tasks:** Tasks can be toggled between completed and pending states, and can be deleted.
- **Sort and Filter:** Tasks can be filtered by completion status and sorted by priority or due date.
